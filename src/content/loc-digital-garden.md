## What is LoC Digital Garden?

We were inspired by [Maggie Appleton's ethos on publishing personal knowledge on the web](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history) to create a ‘digital garden’ for the Ladies of Code Community. A digital garden is a catalogue of exploratory ideas which will be refined and grow overtime, as Maggie says: "Rather than presenting a set of polished articles, displayed in reverse chronological order, these sites act more like free form, work-in-progress wikis." 

This ethos seemed to line up well with the [LoC Group coding sessions](https://ladiesofcodegroupsessions.github.io/) where a group of community members frequently get together to collaborate on exploratory and often unfinished work, with the purpose of learning.

## What we built
During the regular group coding sessions we built the [LoC Digital garden](https://github.com/LadiesOfCodeGroupSessions/loc-digital-garden).
The technologies used were:  TypeScript, Vue, and Nuxt3.

We also experimented with a new testing suite: Vitest and some other interesting format/lint tools.

## How we built it

We tried as best we could to work on the project with the following goals in mind:
- TDD
- Pairing
- Well run project, using the github milestones & issues feature to manage chunks of work
- Encourage best coding practices, e.g. use linters, formatters, CI to fail builds when tests don't pass

## What we'd like now

We'd really welcome contributors to the project. Either [technical contributors](https://github.com/LadiesOfCodeGroupSessions/loc-digital-garden#becoming-a-technical-contributor-to-the-digital-garden) or [content contributors](https://github.com/LadiesOfCodeGroupSessions/loc-digital-garden#adding-a-post-to-the-digital-garden).

We'd really like for this garden to grow and be of value to the LoC community.
